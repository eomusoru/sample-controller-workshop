# Sample Controller Workshop

Prerequisites:
- git needs to be installed
- go, at least version 1.13
- have access to a simple IDE, I will be using Visual Code (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)
    - also check and install the go extensions avilable for your IDE
- most of the commands we will perform will be done in a shell, for windows powershell wouldÂ be better than cmd
- have access to a kubernetes cluster, doesn't matter local or remote. For local you could use:
    -  minikube https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube
    -  kind https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind
